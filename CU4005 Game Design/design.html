<p class="text2"> These are 3 of the games that I have developed either on my own or as part of a team during my time at university: </p>
<ol>
<li class="text"> Dash Royale </li>
<p class="text2"> This game was developed by myself during the first year and I deem it to be my best piece of that year. </p>
<ul>
<li class="text2">This game for 2 players.</li>
<li class="text2">It has a versus mode and a cooperative mode.</li>
<li class="text2">In versus mode players have to fight each other in an arena surrounded by red lasers and the one that depletes their battery first loses.</li>
<li class="text2">To deplete their battery by 1 line, a player has to touch the laser, either by dashing into it themselves or by getting pushed into it by the other player.</li>
<li class="text2">A player charges up their dash by pressing Up->Right->Down->Left, which charges 1 line. This has to be done 4 times to be fully charged.</li>
<li class="text2">At full charge a player can dash away towards the opponent, pushing them into the red laser if they hit them or end up into the laser themselves if the opponent dodges their attack.</li>
<li class="text2">In cooperative mode the blue player has to protect the green player from getting hit by boulders.</li>
<li class="text2">There's 3 boulders, a small square, a small rectangle and a giant square. The blue player can use their charge to dash away the giant square as well as the little ones.</li>
<li class="text2">The green player however has to use their dash to dodge incoming boulders which weren't dashed away by the blue player.</li>
<li class="text2">The green player can be hit by a boulder 5 times before game over.</li>
</ul>

<li class="text"> Bouncy Bullets </li>
<p class="text2"> This game was developed by myself during the second year and I deem it to be my best piece of that year. </p>
<ul>
<li class = "text2">This is a computer game for 2 to 4 players.</li>
<li class = "text2">The game has 3 different environments: Desert, Mountain and Forest. Every kind of resource can be found in every kind of environement, but some resources are a lot more abundant in certain environments.</li>
<li class = "text2">Every player has a randomized starting point on the map, all having a different environment.</li>
<li class = "text2">The Desert has a higher chance of finding oil and sand.</li>
<li class = "text2">The Mountain has a higher chance of finding gold, coal and stone.</li>
<li class = "text2">The Forest has a higher chance of finding wood, water and food.</li>
<li class = "text2">The wood, stone and sand are resources that are only used for building houses. Houses help with the amount of humans you can have in total.</li>
<li class = "text2">Food and water are resources required to keep your humans alive and to allow them to reproduce. The more food and water you have collected, the more humans can be kept alive.</li>
<li class = "text2">Having a higher population of humans also allows you to take over more unexplored teritorry and increases your strength, meaning that they are also the way to take over an enemy teritorry, but it costs more humans.</li>
<li class = "text2">Oil, gold and coal are resources that add to your overall score, with oil being worth 5 points per litre, gold being worth 3 points per gold ore piece and coal being worth 1 point per coal piece.</li>
<li class = "text2">Oil, gold and coal are not shown on the map once you discover an area and they are hidden underground. To dig out oil, gold and coal, you have to build and excavation site, which costs wood and stone.</li>
<li class = "text2">The player that has the most points at the end of the game wins. The game has adjustable timer based on the host's choice, ranging from 10 to 60 minutes.</li>

<ul>
<li class = "text2"> This game is for 4 players only.</li>
<li class = "text2"> Requirements: A coin, a magazine and 2 identical decks of cards. The magazine is placed on the centre of the table and the coin on the centre of the magazine.</li>
<li class = "text2"> 1 player from both teams is assigned the role of the dealer. The dealer receives a deck of cards. </li>
<li class = "text2"> The other players are assigned the roles of the snappers. They have to keep one hand on the corner of the table and cover their eyes with their left hand. (No peeking!) </li>
<li class = "text2"> The dealers sit diagonally from each other, same as the coin snappers. </li>
<li class = "text2"> The dealers have to deal 1 card at a time: Dealer 1 --> Dealer 2 --> Dealer 1 --> Dealer 2 --> etc. </li>
<li class = "text2"> When 2 cards dealt by both dealers are the same (color doesn't matter), it's a snap! </li>
<li class = "text2"> When a snap happens, the dealers have to quickly tap their partner to signal them that they can touch the coin. </li>
<li class = "text2"> When the coin snapper is tapped, they have to quickly touch the coin before the opposing snapper, while still keeping one hand covering their eyes. </li>
<li class = "text2"> The team that first touches the coin gets a point. </li>
<li class = "text2"> Game ends after all cards are dealt and the team with most points wins. </li>
