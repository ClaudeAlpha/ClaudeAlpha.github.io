<p class="text2"> These are 3 of the games that I have developed either on my own or as part of a team during my time at university so far: </p>
<ol>
<li class="text"> Dash Royale </li>
<p class="text2"> This game was developed by myself during the first year and I deem it to be my best piece of that year. </p>
<ul>
<li class="text2">This game is for 2 players.</li>
<li class="text2">It has a versus mode and a cooperative mode.</li>
<li class="text2">In versus mode players have to fight each other in an arena surrounded by red lasers and the one that depletes their battery first loses.</li>
<li class="text2">To deplete their battery by 1 line, a player has to touch the laser, either by dashing into it themselves or by getting pushed into it by the other player.</li>
<li class="text2">A player charges up their dash by pressing Up->Right->Down->Left, which charges 1 line. This has to be done 4 times to be fully charged.</li>
<li class="text2">At full charge a player can dash away towards the opponent, pushing them into the red laser if they hit them or end up into the laser themselves if the opponent dodges their attack.</li>
<li class="text2">In cooperative mode the blue player has to protect the green player from getting hit by boulders.</li>
<li class="text2">There's 3 boulders, a small square, a small rectangle and a giant square. The blue player can use their charge to dash away the giant square as well as the little ones.</li>
<li class="text2">The green player however has to use their dash to dodge incoming boulders which weren't dashed away by the blue player.</li>
<li class="text2">The green player can be hit by a boulder 5 times before game over.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li class = "text2"> This a singleplayer open world survival game.</li>
<li class = "text2"> The aim of the game is to survive for as long as possible by keeping track of your health, hunger and stamina.</li>
<li class = "text2"> You can harvest blackberries and blueberries from bushes and you can also obtain raw meat from roaming elks that you have to run after to kill. </li>
<li class = "text2"> You can use the cooking pots scattered around the map to cook your raw meat and obtain cooked meat, which restores a lot more hunger. </li>
<li class = "text2"> Both elks and tribesmen respawn in a random location some time after being killed, and all berry bushes regrow their berries after 10 minutes. </li>
<li class = "text2"> You are also constantly being chased by 4 tribesmen who want to kill you for tresspassing, they are faster than your normal speed, so you have to either fight or flee. </li>
<li class = "text2"> Your health will not regenerate while your hunger is below 85%, so you constantly have to keep track and keep your character fed after a battle or chase. </li>
