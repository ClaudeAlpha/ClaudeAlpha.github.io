<p class="text2"> These are 3 of the best games that I have developed either on my own or as part of a team during my time at university: </p>
<ol>
<li class="text"> Chase Escape </li>
<p class="text2"> This game was developed by myself using the Unity Engine during the third year of university. </p>
<ul>
<p class="text2"> This game features: </p>
<li class="text2">A chaser enemy that runs after the player, avoids obstacles and jumps over pits.</li>
<li class="text2">An ambusher enemy that hides and breaks out of a large box when you get too close and attacks you with energy balls. </li>
<li class="text2">The ability to restart the game from the beginning at any point by pressing R.</li>
<li class="text2">A playable character that constantly moves forward on its own and your entire task is to press space to jump over obstacles. </li>
<li class="text2">A timer and a counter which keeps track of the amount of attempts you take until you win.</li>
</ul>

<li class="text"> Bouncy Bullets </li>
<p class="text2"> This game was developed by myself during the second year and I deem it to be my best piece of that year. </p>
<ul>
<li class = "text2">This is a 2D platformer shooter and it's for 2 players only.</li>
<li class = "text2">It has a versus mode where 2 players fight each other and the first to kill the other one 10 times wins.</li>
<li class = "text2">During gameplay, players can use doors and gravity to move between platforms and their rifles to shoot the other players.</li>
<li class = "text2">The bullets will bounce off the walls and they will disappear after bouncing 10 times or after hitting one of the players.</li>
<li class = "text2">The game also contains a script file where users can set their resolution, maximum bounces, maximum points to win, bullet and player speed, as well as gravity.</li>
<li class = "text2">After each round, the names and kills of the players are recorded into a highscore file which will display the latest 6 matches in the menu.</li>
</ul>

<li class="text"> Battlestage </li>
<p class="text2"> This was my final year project during the third year of university. It doesn't have any gameplay, its purpose is to showcase the </p>
<p class="text2"> management systems incorporated, e.g. the inventory system, the levelling system, the saving and loading and the options menu. </p>
<p class="text2"> This game features: </p>
<ul>
<li class = "text2"> A shop inventory from where you can buy every item in the game.</li>
<li class = "text2"> A player inventory that can have items added and removed from it, as well as automatic alphabetical item sorting.</li>
<li class = "text2"> The ability to equip and unequip items, provided you meet their attribute requirement. </li>
<li class = "text2"> A levelling system with 4 attributes that impact your health, stamina and amount of items you can equip. </li>
<li class = "text2"> An options menu that allows you to choose between 3 screen resolutions, as well as being able to modify sound and music volume. </li>
<li class = "text2"> A saving system that allows you to save the game into 1 of 3 slots as well as being able to load the game from any slot. </li>
</ul>
